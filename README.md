## MSB1015_Assignment3
Welcome to the repository of MSB1015 Assignment 3! Here I keep track of my progress of MSB1015 2019 Assignment 3 at Maastricht University.

## Files
`CPU_time_logP.nf` <- contains the code to calculate the logP values for all compounds. This code also times the duration of this calculation and stores the results in a file. </br>
`CPU_duration.tsv` <- tab-delimited text file that stores the number of CPUs with the corresponding calculation time. </br>
`getSMILES` <- contains the query used to obtain the compounds. </br>
`all_canonical_isomeric_smiles.tsv` <- Results from query (downloaded from query.wikiddata.org, using getSMILES) </br>
`short.tsv` <- file with only 5 smiles to test code before running it on 158800 smiles.
`Example_files` <- folder with example files provided by Egon Willighagen.
